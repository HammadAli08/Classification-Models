# Classification Models Project
Explore supervised machine learning classification algorithms on real-world datasets

ðŸ“Š Overview
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks where I apply various classification techniques to structured datasets. Youâ€™ll find:

Binary and multi-class classification problems

Implementation of popular ML models using scikit-learn

Detailed performance evaluation and interpretation of results

Each notebook walks through:

Data preprocessing and feature encoding

Model selection and training

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Confusion matrix visualization and insights

ðŸ§ª Notebooks
